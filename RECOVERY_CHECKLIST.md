  cd /path/to/incomplete-project
  ```

- [ ] **Install Enhanced Agent OS**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kimhons/agent-os-extensions.git
  cd agent-os-extensions
  ./install-extensions.sh
  ```

- [ ] **Verify installation**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/mcp-integration/enhanced-mcp-orchestrator.py --list-tools
  python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --report
  ```

### Afternoon (3-4 hours)
- [ ] **Deep codebase analysis**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --analyze --deep --suggestions
  ```

- [ ] **Git repository analysis**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/git-management/branch-manager.py --analyze --cleanup-suggestions
  ```

- [ ] **Create recovery branch**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/git-management/branch-manager.py --create-branch "recovery-completion-v2"
  ```

- [ ] **Initial product analysis**
  ```bash
  /analyze-product
  ```
  **Prompt**: "Analyze this incomplete 300k+ LOC application. Identify what's built, what's missing, and create a completion strategy."

### End of Day 1 Deliverables
- [ ] **Codebase analysis report** - Understanding of current state
- [ ] **Feature inventory** - List of complete vs incomplete features
- [ ] **Technical debt assessment** - Known issues and duplications
- [ ] **Recovery branch created** - Clean workspace for completion work

## ðŸ“… Day 2: Strategic Planning

### Morning (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Create completion specifications**

- [ ] **Validate specifications**
  - [ ] All incomplete features identified
  - [ ] Dependencies properly mapped
  - [ ] Priority order makes sense
  - [ ] Effort estimates reasonable

### Afternoon (3-4 hours)
- [ ] **Generate task breakdown**
  ```bash
  /create-tasks
  ```
  **Prompt**: "Break down the completion specifications into specific, actionable tasks. Each task should be completable in 2-4 hours."

- [ ] **Review and organize tasks**
  - [ ] Tasks are specific and actionable
  - [ ] Dependencies are clear
  - [ ] Estimated effort is reasonable
  - [ ] Priority order is logical

- [ ] **Set up progress tracking**
  ```bash
  cp .agent-os/templates/progress-tracker.md ./COMPLETION_PROGRESS.md
  ```

### End of Day 2 Deliverables
- [ ] **Completion specifications** - Detailed plan for finishing the app
- [ ] **Task breakdown** - Specific, actionable tasks with priorities
- [ ] **Progress tracking system** - Way to monitor completion progress
- [ ] **Timeline estimate** - Realistic completion timeline

## ðŸ“… Day 3+: Systematic Execution

### Daily Routine (Repeat for each development day)

#### Morning Setup (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Review progress**
  ```bash
  cat COMPLETION_PROGRESS.md
  python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --progress-report
  ```

- [ ] **Select today's tasks**
  - [ ] Choose 2-3 tasks based on priority and dependencies
  - [ ] Ensure tasks can be completed in one day
  - [ ] Check for any blockers or dependencies

- [ ] **Optimize context for first task**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/context/context-manager.py --optimize --task "first-task-name"
  ```

#### Task Execution Loop (Repeat for each task)
- [ ] **Execute task with enhanced Agent OS**
  ```bash
  /execute-tasks
  ```
  **Prompt Template**: "Complete [TASK_NAME]. Use the codebase analysis to understand existing patterns and avoid code duplication. Follow established conventions and integrate with existing architecture."

- [ ] **Verify task completion**
  - [ ] Feature works as expected
  - [ ] No code duplications introduced
  - [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
  - [ ] Code follows existing patterns
  - [ ] Git commit is clean and on correct branch

- [ ] **Update progress tracking**
  ```bash
  # Update COMPLETION_PROGRESS.md
  # Mark task as complete
  # Note any issues or learnings
  ```

#### End of Day Review (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Generate daily progress report**
  ```bash
  python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --daily-report
  ```

- [ ] **Check code quality metrics**
  - [ ] Duplication levels
  - [ ] Test coverage
