# Codebase Analyzer

The Codebase Analyzer is a powerful enhancement that enables Agent OS to understand and work with large, complex codebases. It provides a suite of tools for analyzing your code, identifying patterns, preventing duplication, and providing insights for refactoring and improvement.

## Key Features

- **Deep Code Analysis:** The analyzer can parse and understand your code, identifying functions, classes, dependencies, and other important structural elements.
- **Code Duplication Prevention:** The system can detect and prevent code duplication, helping you maintain a clean and efficient codebase.
- **Dependency Mapping:** The analyzer can map the dependencies between different parts of your code, providing a clear picture of your project's architecture.
- **Code Quality Metrics:** The system can calculate a range of code quality metrics, such as complexity and test coverage, to help you track and improve the quality of your code.
- **Refactoring Suggestions:** Based on its analysis, the system can provide suggestions for refactoring and improving your code.

## How It Works

The Codebase Analyzer works by recursively scanning your project's source code and building a detailed model of its structure and dependencies. It uses a combination of static analysis techniques and language-specific parsers to understand your code at a deep level.

Once the analysis is complete, the system can provide you with a range of insights and reports, including:

- **A detailed map of your codebase**, showing the relationships between different files and modules.
- **A list of duplicated code blocks**, along with suggestions for how to refactor them.
- **A report on your project's code quality metrics**, including complexity, test coverage, and other important indicators.
- **A list of refactoring suggestions**, based on the analysis of your code.

## Usage

The Codebase Analyzer is enabled by default in the enhanced version of Agent OS. You can configure its behavior in the `config/enhanced-config.yml` file.

To use the Codebase Analyzer, you can run the `codebase-analyzer.py` script:

```bash
# Perform a full analysis of your codebase
python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --analyze

# Get a report on the analysis results
python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --report

# Get refactoring suggestions
python3 .agent-os/codebase-analysis/codebase-analyzer.py --suggestions
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Code Quality:** The analyzer helps you identify and fix code quality issues, leading to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
- **Reduced Technical Debt:** By identifying and preventing code duplication and other anti-patterns, the system helps you reduce technical debt and keep your project on track.
- **Better Architectural Insights:** The dependency mapping feature provides a clear picture of your project's architecture, helping you make better design decisions.
- **More Effective Refactoring:** The refactoring suggestions provide a clear roadmap for improving your code, making it easier to refactor your project and improve its quality over time.
